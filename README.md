# python_projects

This repository contains a collection of various Python projects that demonstrate my skills in developing programs and using Python programming language.

The projects include a Guessing Word Game, a Higher Lower Game, a Text-Based Game, a Car Race Game, a Shopping Cart, and Leet Code Practices. All projects have been designed with the aim of providing an enjoyable user experience, making use of modern programming concepts and practices.

Each project showcases different features of the Python language and how to implement them in practical applications. The Guessing Word Game challenges the player to guess a word within a set number of attempts. The Higher Lower Game tests the player's ability to guess a number correctly within a given range. The Text-Based Game provides an interactive story for the player to follow. The Car Race Game is a simple 2D racing game where the player races against computer-controlled cars. The Shopping Cart program allows the user to simulate a shopping experience by adding and removing items from a virtual cart. The Leet Code Practices include solutions to various coding challenges found on the LeetCode platform.

Overall, these projects aim to demonstrate my understanding of Python programming and my ability to develop programs that are both functional and user-friendly.
